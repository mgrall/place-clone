# place-clone
A quick standalone variant of the popular web application /r/place.

On the 1st of April 2022, the developers over at reddit.com released their second version of /r/place, a collaborative canvas on which a single user could only place a single tile every five minutes.
Together with their first version in 2017, the team at Reddit published a blog post detailing their obstacles when developing the app, which can be found here: https://www.redditinc.com/blog/how-we-built-rplace/
The 2017 version can be found as an open source Reddit server plugin on GitHub. 

This motivated me to make a quick standalone version of /r/place which doesn't require running a private Reddit server instance and doesn't have to deal with the struggles of insanely high user volume.

I chose to use Firebase for this project, as I've never used it before, and it seemed like a quick way to get a prototype up and running.

My current version can be accessed here (Desktop only): https://place-66971.web.app/
